# When to use client components and when server components

by default, all components that you define inside app directory, are server components, unless you specify it using 'use client'

Rule of thumb: always use server components, unless you have a specific reason to use a client component.

**What are those specific reasons?**

- If you want to add any interactivity and event listeners such as onclick onchange, ...
- If you want to use (react hooks) or any custom hooks that depends on react hooks
- If you need to access to any browser specific APIs, for example you want to access window object or intersection observer
- If you want to use react class component

# Common patterns when you want to compose your client components and server components together to create your application

- Move your client components as further down as you can to the leaves of your component tree. So, therefore Nextjs can optimize the performance of your application by rendering as much as possible on the server.

For example in the below example

<img width="841" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-03 at 20 06 24" src="https://github.com/Arghun-dev/NextJS-13-Promises-For-Props/assets/53907570/b2b141b1-e542-4ebd-ae4f-6e057109f52d">

as you can see we have search bar which needs to be a client component, it needs client interactivity, instead of turning this whole navbar or the whole layout into a client component, just because this search bar needs interactivity you can abstract the interactivity logic of the search bar into its own client components and then import it inside of your layout, which is a server component.

Now, when composing server and client components. Behind the scene, React is going to render all your server components on the server. It's going to then send the results of your server component s to the client, now during this stage if it encounters any client component is going to skip rending it and it's going to create a little slot for this client component. Once the result is sent to the client side, these client components are going to be rendered, and they're going to just be filled into this slots that was coming from the server. Merging the result of your server render and client render together.

Now, it will be the same, if you're nesting a server component inside of a client component, so your server component is going to be rendered on the server the result is sent to the client, once the client is rendered it's going to then this result of your server component is going to just be plugged into where it needs to be plugged in. And we know already that server components can only be passed in as children to client components. So, you're client component is not aware of what it is, that is going to be rendered inside of it's children, it only knows where exactly these children is supposed to be rendered. But once it actually gets rendered on the client side, it just plugs in whatever that came from the sever side which is the result of your server component and it's going to plug it inside that specific slot that was left for your server component.

Now, as I mentioned already if you want to nest a server component inside a client component you have to pass it as children. **You can not import a server component in a client component, doing so will turn that server component into a client component and if your server component is an async function it's going to throw an error.**

Look at the below example:

```js
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";

// this pattern will **not** work!
// you cannot import a server component into a client component.
import ServerComponent from "./ServerComponent";

export default function ClientComponent({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState("");

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>{count}</button>
      <ServerComponent />
    </>
  );
}
```

The above example will not work, because you can not import a server component inside of a client component. **instead you have to pass your server component as a children to your client component**.

So, you're going to refactor your client component to accept a `children`. You're going to have a slot open for any children that's going to be plugged in here. Now, this happens to be a server component, it can also be a client component. So, your parent client component is not even aware of what it is that is going to be rendered here, it just has a slot open for any children that's going to be plugged in here. So the code will be like this:

```js
// This pattern works:
// You can pass a Server Component as a child or prop of a client component.

import ClientComponent from "./ClientComponent";
import ServerComponent from "./ServerComponent";

// Pages in Next.js are server components by default
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <ClientComponent>
      <ServerComponent />
    </ClientComponent>
  );
}
```

This is exactly the same pattern that we're going to actually use to use react-context or to share a global context inside of the app router or within root layout. Because, react-context uses react hooks and react hooks can only be used in client components, so we're going to have a context provider just similar to the above example as a client component and we're going to plug in the rest of our application pages and layouts as server components inside of this context provider so we can share that context throughout our client side components.

**Keep in mind when working with server and client components is whenever you're passing props from a server components to client components that prop or value needs to be serializable, it needs to be able to be converted to a string, because you're crossing the boundry from the server to the client, it has to travel over the network it needs to be converted to a string, so things like function, Date, ... can't be passed in directly that's something to just keep in mind**

So, if you're fetching data on the server side and passing data around in your server components they don't need to be serialized, but any time you're crssing the boundary between the client side and the server side your props need to be serializable.

Now, to keep your server only codes out of your client components and you're writing functions and modules that only meant to run on the server to prevent them from leaking or be called or be imported into client components you can use the `server-only` package from the react team to mark a file or a module as server only code and anytime any function is imported from that file to a client side component it's going to throw a build error.

Example:

`$. npm i server-only`

```js
import "server-only";

export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch(API);
  return res.json();
}
```

and now if you want to import this `getData` function or any function from this module into a client component, it will throw a build error.

The other pattern that I want to talk about is using `third-party` packages. These packages can be UI libraries can be theme providers or authentication providers, which they often depend on react hooks and react context to share that state or concern throughout your application. And because these server components and app router is something new, most of these third-party packages don't support react server components or they do not have 'use client' directive and you can not use them inside your react server components. You can still use them inside your own client components that have that 'use client' directive up top and that support any react hooks and functionality. But you can not use them directly inside your react server components.

So, the workaround is to wrap those specific packages components coming from these libraries inside of your own client so therefore they can have access to react hooks, context states.

For example if you import a component from a third party UI library like antd, MUI, ... that doesn't yet support the app router or this `use client` directive, you can import `use client` inside of your own client component and then you can import any UI component from antd. and then you created your own client component you can import it inside the server component and use it.

And as I mentioned some of these packages are depend on the react global context provider to share these functionality throughout your application.

More two things that I wanted to mention here, we talked about passing props from server components to client components. But when you want to share data between server components, how would you go about doing them. Whould you pass props from server components to server components or not?

in server components, there is no need to pass props between themselves for two reasons:

1. First reason, is that if you're fetching data for example inside your layout and you think ok I fetch this data in the layout let me just pass this data to my page component. Now, there is no need to do that. You can co-locate your data fetching with the component that actually needs it, because Next.js behind the scenes is going to deduplicate your requests, so any component can fetch data as it requires without worrying about duplicate requests, because Next.js is going to use fetch-cache, if there is a similar request between the layout or a page so it's not going to call or fetch twice it's going to use that same thing so there's no need to pass this data as props. And for evey other thing for every other thing like logic and functionality you can use the native Javascript modules for sharing these logics between server components. For example if your need to create a connection to your database you can use the Singelton pattern natively in Javascript modules to create a connection to your database and then share it between any other react server components.

For example in the code if you try to use next-themes package ThemeProvider you will get error and it says `createContext` only works in client components. Add the 'use client' directive at the top of the file to use it.

But we know the `root layout` cannot be client component. If this was any other layout besides the root layout we could add 'use client' directive up top of the file.

But we also learned about another pattern and that is to move our client components as further as possible or deeper as possible inside or down in the tree of our components rather than turning the whole layout into a client component.

But you remember I told you can pass server components as children to your client components.

So, to be able to wrap my root layout with for example `next-themes` ThemeProvider. you need to create another file called `providers.tsx` like below and use `use client` and then use it in root layout.

```js
"use client";

import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

export default function Providers({ children }) {
  return <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
}
```

and then in root layout

layout.tsx:

```js
import "./globals.css";
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import Providers from "./providers";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

now, it will work without any issue, because you're passing server components as child to `Providers` which is a client component. and we didn't add 'use client' on top of root layout component.

**Important**

- Next.js is actually pre-renders client components on the server. for a faster experience and then hyderates that HTML with react on the client side. Therefore it also runs this client component on the server.
